# DEFT_LB experiments: directions A, B and C

Code: `src/DeftLateBinding.{h,cpp}`, routing `DEFT_LB`, selections `DEFT_HEUR`, `DEFT_QL`.

## What is compared

| Variant | Direction | Routing relation | VL decision | Information used |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DeFT` | baseline | DeFT (XY, fixed pair) | offline LUT (rho = 0.01) | none at run time |
| `A_mindist` | A | DeFT (XY, fixed pair) | at injection: minimal total hops | static distance |
| `A_random` | A | DeFT (XY, fixed pair) | at injection: uniform random pair | none |
| `A_oracle` | A (upper bound) | DeFT (XY, fixed pair) | at injection: hops + beta * occupancy near both VLs | instantaneous global state (not implementable) |
| `CI_random` | control | interposer-only late binding (chiplets XY, exit from LUT, interposer OE) | random among legal outputs | none |
| `CI_heur` | C | same as CI | stateless heuristic | router-local |
| `CI_ql` | B | same as CI | Q-learning | router-local + learned residual |
| `FULL_random` | control | full late binding (OE on chiplets and interposer) | random | none |
| `FULL_heur` | C | full late binding | stateless heuristic | router-local |
| `FULL_heurLA` | C (wider budget) | full late binding | heuristic with one-hop lookahead | router-local + neighbour's downstream occupancy |
| `FULL_ql` | B | full late binding | Q-learning | router-local + learned residual |

### Boundaries of the heuristic (direction C)

A heuristic here is a fixed, stateless rule:
* it uses only what the router observes in the current cycle: for each legal output,
  the number of flits in the downstream input buffer of the output VC (what a credit
  counter reports) and whether the output VC is held by another packet;
* it adds static topology knowledge: the minimal remaining hop count after the move
  (towards the best remaining exit/entry candidate);
* cost(o) = heur_w * downstream_flits(o) + heur_busy * [output VC busy] + hops_after(o);
  the minimum wins, ties are broken at random;
* no memory, no learning, no global or remote information; the two weights are chosen
  once on tuning seeds (101, 102) from a 3x3 grid and frozen.
`FULL_heurLA` widens the budget by one hop (the neighbour's downstream occupancy on its
cheapest continuation) to show what more information buys without learning.

### Q-learning (direction B)

cost(o) = ql_w * downstream_flits(o) + ql_busy * [busy] + hop_cost * hops_after(o) + R(o).
R is a learned residual (time beyond the static hop estimate), kept per router, output
port and destination chiplet (`ql_key 1`) or destination router (`ql_key 0`). When a head
flit reaches the front of an input buffer, the router that sent it updates
R <- R + alpha * (1 + V_here - hop_cost * hops_after - R), where V_here is the receiving
router's minimum cost over its legal outputs (TD(0), observed local costs as step costs).
With alpha = 0 the learner is exactly the heuristic (checked: identical runs). The local
weights are set to the heuristic's tuned values, so B and C differ only by learning.
Safety does not depend on the selection: both choose only among legal outputs of the
routing relation.

### Safety evidence
* `formal/impl_relation_check.py`: model check of the implemented relations (fixed pair,
  CI, FULL) on 897 fault masks (CDG acyclic, no dead ends, no livelock).
* `drain_tests.py`: drain-mode runs for every variant (all-pairs burst on 11 masks x 2
  seeds, over-saturated random tables on 4 masks): every packet delivered, no dead ends.

## Tuning budget (seeds 101, 102 only; never used for evaluation)

Each configuration is run on 4 cells (uniform, hotspot, chipperm on the fault-free
network, uniform on 0x1111) x 2 loads (~0.8 and ~1.1 x DeFT Lsat, `results/load_points.json`)
x 2 seeds = 16 runs. Selection criterion: geometric mean of the mean packet latency over
those 16 runs (`choose_tuning.py`; tables in `results/tuning_*.txt`).

| Method | Parameters searched | Configurations | Runs | Chosen |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| DeFT | none (LUT with the default rho = 0.01) | 0 | 0 | - |
| A_mindist, A_random | none | 0 | 0 | - |
| A_oracle | oracle_beta in {0.25, 0.5, 1, 2} | 4 | 64 | beta = 0.5 |
| CI/FULL_random | none | 0 | 0 | - |
| C: FULL_heur (CI_heur, FULL_heurLA reuse it) | heur_w in {0.5, 1, 2} x heur_busy in {0, 4, 8} | 9 | 144 | w = 1.0, busy = 0.0 |
| B: FULL_ql (CI_ql reuses it) | ql_alpha in {0.05, 0.2, 0.5} x ql_key in {0, 1} x ql_eps in {0, 0.05}, local weights fixed to C's choice | 12 (+9 inherited) | 192 (+144) | alpha = 0.05, key = 1 (destination chiplet), eps = 0 |

Notes:
* B received more tuning than C: its own 12 configurations on top of the 9 that fixed
  its local weights. Any B-over-C gain must be read with this asymmetry in mind.
* All tuning was done on FULL and applied unchanged to CI (and to FULL_heurLA).
* The chosen ql_alpha (0.05) is the smallest value of its grid, so a smaller rate may be
  better; the grid was not extended, to keep the budget fixed in advance.
* The heuristic ranking is flat at the top (the four best configurations lie within 3 %
  of each other in geometric-mean latency), so its choice is weakly determined.
* The drain tests were re-run with the frozen parameters
  (`results/drain_summary.csv`; the pre-tuning run is kept as `drain_summary_pretuning.csv`).
